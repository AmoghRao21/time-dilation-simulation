# Time Dilation in Extreme Gravitation 🌌⏳

This repository contains a Python simulation of **gravitational time dilation** based on the **Schwarzschild equation**. It demonstrates how time slows down near massive celestial bodies like black holes, using the following equation:

Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - (2GM / rc²))

## Features
✅ Calculates time dilation near a massive object (Earth, black hole, etc.)  
✅ Visualizes time dilation with a graph 📊  
✅ Uses Schwarzschild radius as a reference for event horizon detection  
✅ Simple and customizable—modify mass (\(M\)) for different celestial bodies  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-dilation-simulation.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python time_dilation.py
   ```

## Output Example
The script generates a graph showing how time dilation changes as an object moves closer to a massive body’s Schwarzschild radius.
