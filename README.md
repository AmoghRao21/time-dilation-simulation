Time Dilation in Extreme Gravitation 🌌⏳
This repository contains a Python simulation of gravitational time dilation based on the Schwarzschild equation. It demonstrates how time slows down near massive celestial bodies like black holes, using the following equation:

Features
✅ Calculates time dilation near a massive object (Earth, black hole, etc.)
✅ Visualizes time dilation with a graph 📊
✅ Uses Schwarzschild radius as a reference for event horizon detection
✅ Simple and customizable—modify mass (
𝑀
M) for different celestial bodies

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
How to Run
Clone the repository:
sh

Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-dilation-simulation.git
Install dependencies:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy matplotlib
Run the script:
